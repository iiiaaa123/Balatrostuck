Balatrostuck is a mod for the popular poker roguelike Balatro aiming to add Homestuck-related content to the game.

Why? Why not!

## Mod additions

- **120 new Jokers** with objects, scenes and refereces to the comic
- **13 Zodiac cards** to level up your played ranks
- **12 Aspect cards** with run-shaping effects
- **10 new challenges and 4 new decks** to test your Balatro skills
- Paradox edition, spectral cards, tags and many more goodies for both Homestuck fans and Balatro diehards

## Aspect system
Aspects grant powerful boons - double leveling, duplicate tags, mass enhance your cards and much more, all of this **without using a joker slot.**
Gaining repeated aspect cards further levels them up, making your insane effects stronger. However you can only have one aspect active at once and switching aspects levels them down, so pick carefuly!

Each of the 12 aspects affect different areas of the game.
They were fine tuned to be as different as possible from eachother, each having their own set of synergies with basegame and modded content.
A Breath run will be massively different from a Blood run which will be massively different from a Mind run. Which one will become your favorite?

## Zodiac system

Every card rank has its own consumable, allowing you to level your 3s, Aces and 4s just like your Straights and Flushes!

Unlike planets the Zodiac cards don't directly increase their values, instead granting them new effects! Boost your luck-based effects with 8s, gain money with Queens and retrigger played 2s; each number now has their own set of synergies you can build atop of, allowing for many more builds and combinations.
