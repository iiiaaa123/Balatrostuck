Balatrostuck is a mod for the popular poker roguelike Balatro aiming to add Homestuck-related content to the game.

Why? Why not!

## Mod additions

- **[TBD] new Jokers** featuring various jokes and moments from Homestuck!
- **12 Aspect cards** with insane game-altering effects
- **13 Zodiac cards** to level up your played ranks
- **1 new Spectral card** that interacts with the new Aspect system
- **4 new Vouchers** - 2 for the Zodiac system, 2 for the Aspect system
- A fully new **Alternian Blind** gamemode with harder scaling and new bosses for an even harder challange
- Paradox Cards, new tags and many more goodies for both Homestuck fans and Balatro diehards!

## Aspect system
Aspects grant powerful boons - create negative consumables, duplicate tags, mass enhance your cards and much more, all of this **without using a joker slot.**

Gaining repeated aspect cards further levels them up, making your insane effects even crazier. However you can only have one aspect active at once and switching aspects levels them down, so pick carefuly!

## Zodiac system

Every card rank now also has its own consumable, allowing you to level your 3s, Aces and 4s just like your Straights and Flushes!

Unlike planets the Zodiac cards don't (just) increase their values, instead granting them new effects! Boost your luck-based effects with 8s, gain money with Queens and retrigger played 2s; each number now has their own set of synergies you can build atop of, allowing for many more builds and combinations.
